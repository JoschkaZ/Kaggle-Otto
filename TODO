- Learning how to run code in the cloud
  test neural_network.py execution in the cloud
  test random_forest.py execution in the cloud
  

- Creating general feature transformation routines.
  Example: features_to_be_loged  = [feature_a, feature_b]
  -> add log_feature_a & log_feature_b to dataframe
  
  
- Hyper parameter optimisation routines
  For every model: define a space of parameter settings
  Develop a search algorithm to find ideal settings
